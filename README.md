PDF to Speech Converter
This Python script extracts text from a PDF file and converts it into an audio file using pyttsx3 (a text-to-speech library). This is useful for listening to documents instead of reading them manually.

Features
1. Reads and extracts text from all pages of a PDF.
2. Converts the extracted text into an MP3 audio file.
3. Uses offline text-to-speech, meaning no internet connection is required.
4. Automatically handles line breaks and whitespace for better readability.
